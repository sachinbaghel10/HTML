    <h2 id="href">href link</h2>

    <p>If you look at code for a lot of other sites, you might come across a number of <strong>markup styles</strong> , including attribute values without quotes. This is permitted in certain circumstances, but it can also break your markup in other circumstances. For example, if we revisit our link example from earlier, we could write a basic version with only the href attribute, like this:</p>

    <h2 id="Title">Title link</h2>

    <p>As written above, the browser misinterprets the markup, mistaking the title attribute for three attributes: a title attribute with the value The, and two Boolean attributes, Mozilla and homepage. Obviously, this is not intended! It will cause errors or unexpected behavior, as you can see in the live example below. Try hovering over the link to view the title text!</p>

        When <b><u>HTML</u></b> was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. Doctypes used to look something like this:
        <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
        Copy to ClipboardCopy to Clipboard
        More recently,<i> the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right.</i> <!DOCTYPE html> is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!

        One of the most common equations in all of physics is 
        <var>E</var>=<var>m</var>
        <var>c</var><sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This in the formula of 
        <var>(a+b)</var><sup>2</sup> =
        <var>a</var><sup>2</sup>+
        <var>b</var><sup>2</sup>
        <var>+2ab</var>

        will result in the complete annihilation of both particles.
